# The CarND Capstone Project
This project uses ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following! The code is tested using the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases) and is executed on the Udacity self-driving car Carla.

# System Architecture
Description from Udacity Classroom
The following is a system architecture diagram showing the ROS nodes and topics used in the project. You can refer to the diagram throughout the project as needed. The ROS nodes and topics shown in the diagram are described briefly in the Code Structure section below, and more detail is provided for each node in later classroom concepts of this lesson.

# Code Structure
Below is a brief overview of the repo structure, along with descriptions of the ROS nodes. 

##  /ros/src/tl_detector/
This package contains the traffic light detection node.
![image alt text](imgs/tl-detector-ros-graph.png)

## /ros/src/waypoint_updater/
This package contains the waypoint updater node
![image alt text](imgs/waypoint-updater-ros-graph.png)

## /ros/src/twist_controller/
Carla is equipped with a drive-by-wire (dbw) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control. This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle

# Training steps
Below is a brief overview of the traffic light detector training.

## 1. Get the SSD model from [Tensorflow detection model zoo](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_inception_v2_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz)
Graph of the SSD model:
<div class="test">
<img src="imgs/ssd_graph.png" width="600" />
</div>

## 2. Get and Annotate traffic light images for training.
Get training images from simulator and rosbag(real track) file.
<div class="test">
<img src="imgs/training_sim_image.png" width="400" />
<img src="imgs/training_real_image.png" width="400" />
</div>


## 3. Train the SSD model by annotated images, get sim_model.pb and real_model.pb file finally.
Main hyperparameter:  
```
batch_size: 10  
reshape:(300, 300)  
num_steps:10000  
optimizer_learning_rate: 0.004  
num_classes: 3  
```
<div class="test">

</div>

## 4. Use trained model to predict simulator and real track traffic light.
The traffic light prediction visualization:

# Installation and Exceution Instructions

This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

```

8. Test environment. If no error, environment is ok
```

python ./object_detection/exporter_test.py

```

### Start ROS and Simulator
1. Make ROS workspace
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
```

2. Run ROS for Highway Track

4. Run ROS for Test Lot Track
```
roslaunch launch/styx_sim_testlot.launch
```

5. Run the simulator and select the *Test Lot* track



### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
